Build a fully functional AI-powered Employee Attendance System called “StaffSense AI”, using lightweight AI (OpenCV) so it runs smoothly on the free Replit tier.

This system must detect employee faces, mark attendance, manage employees, and provide an admin dashboard — all inside a clean, modern web app.

Apply all branding, names, roll numbers, and system requirements exactly.

🔵 1. Branding Requirements

Use this branding everywhere (UI, README, comments, navbar, footer, page titles):

Project Name:

StaffSense AI — AI Face Detection for Employee Attendance

Developed By (Watermark on all pages):

Ayush Pandey (220BTCCSE135)

Suparshva Jain (220BTCCSE154)
Team Name: Team StaffSense

Place this watermark in:

footer of every page

login page

dashboard

attendance page

employee list

logs page

about section

🔵 2. Tech Stack (Replit Free-Tier Friendly)

Use lightweight and compatible technologies:

Python

Flask (web framework)

OpenCV Haar Cascade for face detection (not recognition)

SQLite for database

HTML + CSS + JS

Chart.js for simple analytics

jQuery (optional)

No heavy neural networks. No cloud APIs. No GPU.

🔵 3. Core Features (Lite AI + Real Functionality)

The system must include:

A. Employee Registration

Add new employee (name, employee ID, department).

Capture face images using webcam (20–30 samples).

Save sample images per employee in local folder.

Insert employee details into SQLite.

B. AI Face Detection for Attendance

Live webcam stream using OpenCV.

Face detection using Haar Cascades.

If face matches the stored dataset folder name → mark attendance.

Store attendance with timestamp + date.

Prevent duplicate attendance for the same day.

C. Admin Login System

Admin login page

Username + password hash in database

Session-based authentication

Protect dashboard and admin routes

D. Admin Dashboard

Show:

Total Employees

Today’s Attendance Count

Live Camera Test Button

Today's logs preview

Quick navigation sections

StaffSense AI branding + watermark

E. Attendance Logs Page

Table of all attendance records

Search by employee name or date

Date filter

Export to CSV (optional)

F. Employee Management Module

View all employees

Update employee details

Delete employee

Re-capture face data

G. Mini Analytics (Lightweight)

Charts using Chart.js:

Attendance of the last 7 days

Total attendance vs absences

Daily check-in summary

Use very lightweight logic.

H. Watermark (MANDATORY)

Every page must display:

“Developed by Team StaffSense — Ayush Pandey (220BTCCSE135) & Suparshva Jain (220BTCCSE154)”

🔵 4. Required Project Structure

Create exactly this structure:

/staffsense_ai
    /static
        /css/style.css
        /js/main.js
        /images/logo.png (generated placeholder)
    /templates
        base.html
        login.html
        dashboard.html
        register_employee.html
        capture_face.html
        attendance.html
        view_employees.html
        attendance_logs.html
        analytics.html
    /face_samples/   (store all employee folders)
    haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
    app.py
    database.py
    models.py
    README.md

🔵 5. Flask Backend Requirements
Required Routes:
GET / → login  
POST /login  
GET /logout
GET /dashboard  

GET /register → form  
POST /register → submit form  

GET /capture/<employee_id> → webcam capture page  

GET /attendance → live attendance via webcam  
POST /attendance/mark → store attendance  

GET /employees → list  
POST /employees/update/<id>  
GET /employees/delete/<id>  

GET /logs → attendance logs  
GET /analytics → charts dashboard

🔵 6. SQLite Database Schema

Create database with three tables:

employees

id (PK)

name

emp_id

department

face_folder (path to face samples)

attendance

id

emp_id

date

time

admin

username

password_hash

🔵 7. UI/UX Requirements

Clean, professional look

Blue + white color theme

Navbar with logo text: StaffSense AI

Responsive layout

Use base.html for template inheritance

Beautiful tables

Clean buttons

Sticky footer with watermark

🔵 8. README.md Requirements

Must include:

Project Title

Problem Statement

About StaffSense AI

Features List

Tech Stack

Installation Steps

How Face Detection Works

Screenshot placeholders

Developer Info (names + roll numbers)

🔵 9. Output Requirements (Very Important)

Replit must generate:

Full backend code (Flask)

All HTML templates

CSS file

JS file

Haar Cascade file inclusion

Fully working face detection & attendance

Database creation script

Project folder structure

Instructions to run the project

Everything must be modular, commented, readable, and production-ready for a major project submission.

❗IMPORTANT – DO NOT USE:

Heavy ML models (CNNs, deep learning)

Face recognition libraries requiring high compute

External paid APIs

Large datasets

GPU-required features

Keep everything light, fast, and Replit-free-tier compatible.

🔵 10. FINAL INSTRUCTION

Generate the entire project in one go, with all files, all routes, all code, all templates, and the complete folder structure.
